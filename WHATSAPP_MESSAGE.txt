Good morning/afternoon Sir,

Update on Finfactor Account Aggregator Project:

📊 CURRENT STATUS:
✅ Application is running on localhost:3001
✅ Next.js frontend is operational
✅ API integration with Finfactor/Finvu WealthScape PFM is configured

🎯 CURRENT FOCUS: Database Schema & Data Population

📋 SCHEMA SETUP (Priority):
• Need to create 29 database tables in Supabase
• 3-Layer Architecture:
  - Layer A: Flow & Control (TSP providers, AA gateways, users, consents, auth tokens, API audit logs)
  - Layer B: Canonical Financial Data (FI accounts, transactions, account holders, FIPs, brokers)
  - Layer C: Financial State & Holdings (Deposits, MF, Equity, ETF, NPS summaries, holdings, insights)

📈 DATA POPULATION GOALS:
After schema creation, I need to seed the database with:
• 24 accounts
• 20 account holders
• 17 deposit summaries
• 11 Mutual Fund holdings
• 12 Equity holdings
• Transaction records
• Financial insights

✅ WHAT I'M DOING:
1. Setting up the complete database schema (29 tables) in Supabase
2. Running data seeding scripts to populate test data
3. Verifying data integrity across all 3 layers
4. Testing API connectivity and data flow

📌 EXPECTED OUTCOME:
Once schema and data population is complete:
• Main dashboard will display consolidated financial data
• All modules (Deposits, MF, Equity, ETF, NPS) will show populated data
• API integration will be fully functional with database persistence
• Test dashboard will show successful data flow across all layers

⏭️ NEXT STEPS:
1. Execute schema SQL in Supabase dashboard
2. Run seed script: npm run seed:simple
3. Verify data appears on main dashboard
4. Test all financial modules

Will keep you updated on progress. Thank you!
